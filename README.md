## Setting up the development environment

### Using Visual Studio 2022's CMake integration
You will need to have the following prerequisites installed:

* Visual Studio 2022

Check out the project and make sure to also check out its submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/angryzor/sonic-frontiers-devtools.git
```

Simply open the project folder in Visual Studio 2022 (File > Open > CMake...) and it should automatically detect the CMakeLists.txt file.

The following presets are available:
* x64 Debug: Debug build.
* x64 Debug ImGui Demo: Debug build with ImGui demo window enabled (for editing themes etc.).
* x64 Release: Release build.
* x64 RelWithDebInfo: Release build with debug information.

### Using CMake with the Visual Studio 2022 generator
You will need to have the following prerequisites installed:

* Visual Studio 2022
* CMake 3.28 or higher

Check out the project and make sure to also check out its submodules:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/angryzor/sonic-frontiers-devtools.git
```

Now let CMake do its thing:

```sh
cmake -B build
```

If you have Sonic Frontiers installed in a non-standard location, you can specify that location
with the `DEVTOOLS_GAME_FOLDER` variable:

```sh
cmake -B build -DDEVTOOLS_GAME_FOLDER="C:\ShadowFrontiers"
```

Once CMake is finished, navigate to the build directory and open `devtools.sln` with VS2022.
You should have a fully working environment available.

Building the INSTALL project will install the mod into HedgeModManager's `Mods` directory.
